Version Control: Sept. 14





SVN:subversion
Git/Github: probably use this for version control

Code Control Methods:
LOCO: Lock On Check Out
MOM: Merge on modify
-get latest version, no lock, editable, then on commit it tries to 
automatically merge. If Auto-merge fails then there may be some
manual user input

.git ignore - things that git will ignore when correctly set

Conflicts:
when same code is edited and will not be automatically ignored
-hopefully there will be a warning indicating this

Commit early and often
Don't commit output files ie. file.o files
Don't merge broken code



On start:
clone Remote Repo to the Local Repo
at this point if you commit you are commiting to Local Repo
You need to push to get it to Remote Repository.

Create a git repo:
mkdir repo
cd repo
git init ;  tells the thing to make the actual repository

git add ---tell git to stage changes
git commit --commit the stage changes

git pull = git fetch + git merge to get everything to your 
local repository

Branching: each team member works on their own branch
